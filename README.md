The MATLAB codes (recommended for MATLAB 2023b or later) generate simulation data for fractional OUP, resetting FBM, RL-FBM, Lévy walks, and CTRW. The main scripts compute various statistics, including MSD, MSI, and (EA-)TAMSD. Moreover, the EB parameters for resetting FBM and RL-FBM can be evaluated using the scripts main_EB_reset_fbm and main_EB_RLFBM.

Trajectory data for all models are available on Google Drive:
